Thoughts: apply to MBARI jplace. write a shell script that will take each jplace file, apply the script to it, write the results to an excel sheet, and repeat. Results should be name of jplace, associated cog, percent "confidently" placed. Also consider writing it so that "depth" is taken into account.
