# The_Project
Bio-497 environmental genomics class project: Shelby and Jon

### To do list

__Shelby__
* What numbers in the jplace file correspond to fields? tree and placements
* what is named multiplicity? corresponds to the "nm" value in the jplace file
* draw a small tree and make a small jplace file and show how they correspond to eachother.
* Figure how to tell if placement on the tip vs internal 
* talk to eric about running on phylosift on Mac
* look into EDPL

__Jon__
* What is the likelihood and why is negative. What is more likely vs less likely
* what are the values that corresponde to the reference tree numbers
* figure out how to change what information is displayed on the tree using archaeoptryx
* How to find leaves in the tree section of the jplace file
* Talk to statistican about hidden markov models and other math shit
* Newick file format
* look for figures to use. figure for jplace file, fat tree with placement labels, example of python code

### Project proposal paper:


- __Introduction__
  - Background: talk metagenomics -> phylogenetic trees -> pipeline -> pplacer and fat trees
  - Questions/state of the field: No easy way to extract data. 
  - Primary goals: Write a script to extract a variety of data from jplace
  - Hypothesis: We will write a fucking mind blowing script null: it won't be fucking mind blowing or....analysis of internal vs leaves will alter tree interpretation.
- __Methods__
  - Data type: jplace file/json
  * Annotation pipeline: phylosift
  * Statistics: summary statistics 
  * Software packages: phylosift
- __Expected Outcomes__
  * What we expect to find: Fucking awesome script. extrapolate on how abundance data will influence interpretation
  * Mock figures: Psuedo code, concept map, phylogenetic fat tree vs normal tree 
- __References__
  * Ten references: uuhhhh
