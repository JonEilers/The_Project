# The_Project
Bio-497 environmental genomics class project: Shelby and Jon



Questions that need answering:

Shelby: What numbers in the jplace file correspond to fields? tree and placements

Jon: What is the likelihood and why is negative. What is more likely vs less likely

Shelby: what is named multiplicity? corresponds to the "nm" value in the jplace file

Jon: what are the values that corresponde to the reference tree numbers

Jon: figure out how to change what information is displayed on the tree using archaeoptryx

Shelby: draw a small tree and make a small jplace file and show how they correspond to eachother.

Shelby: Figure how to tell if placement on the tip vs internal 

Jon: How to find leaves in the tree section of the jplace file

Jon: Talk to statistican about hidden markov models and other math shit

Shelby: talk to eric about running on phylosift on Mac

Shelby: look into EDPL

Jon: Newick file format

Jon: Email Robin how much of our proposal paper can be shared if we are basically doing the exact same propject. what sort of reference can we include. 

Jon: look for figures to use. figure for jplace file, fat tree with placement labels, example of python code

Project proposal paper:

section of psuedo code describing what we are trying to do. 

introduction: talk about why we are doing it: relevance. 

mmethods: psuedo code

expected outcome: really fucking awesome script with a few extras if we have time.
